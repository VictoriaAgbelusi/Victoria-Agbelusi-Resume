        <p class="lead mb-4">I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. Iâ€™m not comfortable with settling, and Iâ€™m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.<br><br>
        I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs<br><br>

        I am highly organized. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so Iâ€™m always able to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the team stay on track, too. In my last role, I created a new filing process that increased departmental efficiency 25%.

              â€¢ Here, I was involved with running inventory on the products that come in and go out of the warehouse. This includes making sure that items are actually on the location they say there are. I also was involved with making sure that defective items are properly disposed and accounted for in the system.<br>
              â€¢ Also, in ensuring customer satisfaction, products ordered by the customers are analyzed by myself and a team of designated few before being shipped out to them to ensure that they are not defective or broken. Owing to this, I have won several awards in the warehouse including associate of the month<br>

I also made sure that their rooms were neat and free from potential hazards that may hurt either them or the staffs.<br>
            â€¢ Health monitoring â€“ I made sure to keep a close eye on every single client to be aware of little occurrences, seizures or emotional or physical outburst. I made sure to be aware of any triggers and tried to take out the triggers.<br>
            â€¢ De-escalating violent situation â€“ I used my CPI training (nonviolent crises intervention training) to deescalate physical and violent situations. If Iâ€™m not able to reduce the intensity of the situation, I call the police to step in.<br>
